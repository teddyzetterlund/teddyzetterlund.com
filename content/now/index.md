# What I’m doing now

* **Personal** – We're planning for our second trip to Japan, and this time around we'll know some japanese when we're there, so outside of the usual (nature, biking, exercise, etc.) practicing japanese is in focus.

* **Creative** — During the pandemic I picked up an old hobby again: Table Top Warhammer 40K, and I'm fully invested in it currently. Building models, painting models, attending tournaments, and so on. Lots of fun!

* **Playing** — Nothing at this time, and probaly nothing for a while. Spring is almost here. And the few hours I spend in from of a TV is now japanese movies or learning exercises.

* **Reading** — Goldratt's Rules of Flow. Nothing new here probably, but I like the story format and how they're all anchored to real stories. Also, it's written by Goldratt's daugher and I enjoyed The Choice.
