# What I’m doing now

* **Personal** — Well, we changed our floor in the whole apartment recently, so right now—no new personal projects.

* **Creative** — Working on two courses at the moment: 1) a 1–2 day course on product development flow, and 2) a 2 day course on product market fit and experimentation.

* **Playing** — Red Dead Redemption 2, obviously. And will probably do this for a while. It’s huge, and sometimes I just play poker in the game …

* **Reading** — Reading have had to take the backseat for a while. But I recently read Mastering Leadership: An Integrated Framework for Breakthrough Performance and Extraordinary Business Results. The title is a mouthful and the book is the same, but there’s a lot of good stuff in there—just remember that it’s okay not to read it all.

You will always find an updated view of [my reading list at Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/teddyzetterlund).
