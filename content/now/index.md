# What I’m doing now

* **Personal** – After our second trip to Japan, we're now completely commited. We're studying Japanese every day, and are eagerly awaiting our third trip, and fourth trip!

* **Creative** — During the pandemic I picked up an old hobby again: Table Top Warhammer 40K, and I'm fully invested in it currently. Building models, painting models, attending tournaments, and so on. Lots of fun!

* **Playing** — Looking forward to playing Astro Bot when I've got time for it.

* **Reading** — Re-reading a lot of books I've read in the past, while also listening to some new ones.
