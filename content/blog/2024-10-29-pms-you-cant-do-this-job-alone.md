Do you ever feel like you’re responsible for everything about your product? The strategy, the roadmap, the user experience—even the execution? Product managers often think they need to be able to take on every role, but what if that belief is more harmful than helpful? **What if the best PMs aren’t the ones who try to do it all, but the ones who actively seek and rely on others’ expertise?** In this post, we’re diving into why the most successful product managers are those who understand that they can’t go at it alone—and don’t try to.

## The Real Role of a Product Manager: Film director, not a one-person-band

It’s tempting to think that a PM should have a hand in every part of the product, **but the real value lies in how we enable others to contribute to the product’s success.** Whether that’s synthesizing user insights, seeking feedback from stakeholders, or coordinating the work itself, the PM’s role is about ensuring these elements (and more) align smoothly.

Product management can feel like a one-person band—juggling instruments, switching roles, and playing every note themselves. And honestly, this can feel empowering and like you’re being valuable to the company, but product management isn’t about being a solo act if you want to be truly effective. Instead, **think of a PM as a film director: someone who shapes the vision, directs the flow, and facilitates the work to bring it all together.** While they’re guiding and collaborating with actors, set designers, and editors, they’re also hands-on—sometimes adjusting scenes or making key edits themselves. **The best product managers know when to step in and make decisions directly, and when to let the team’s expertise take center stage.**

**So how can a PM embody the role of a film director?** First, **articulate a clear product story** and share it with your team and stakeholders to ensure everyone is aligned. **Assemble cross-functional teams**—much like bringing together a cast and crew—and **foster open communication** to encourage creativity and the sharing of insights. **Trust your team members** to excel in their areas while you **lead with context**, not control. Succeeding with this approach will build trust from your colleagues and boost your confidence and success as a PM.

## The Power of Collective Insight: Why Diverse Perspectives Matter

**The best product managers know that no single perspective can capture the full picture.** While a PM may have a clear vision for the product, real value emerges when multiple, diverse viewpoints come together—uncovering angles, risks, and opportunities that one person alone would almost certainly miss. A designer may highlight potential friction points in the user experience, while engineering could reveal technical constraints or offer innovative solutions. Marketing might see a missed opportunity to resonate with a target audience, and so on.

When a PM brings these voices together, they aren’t just gathering input; they’re **assembling a holistic view that strengthens every aspect of the product and the value it can deliver.**

**So how can a PM leverage this collective insight?** By fostering a culture of continuous collaboration: organizing collaborative workshops, creating open channels for cross-functional dialogue, and encouraging questions that challenge assumptions. Embracing these insights will lead to a more cohesive team and a product that truly reflects collective expertise.

## Overcoming the “Do-It-All” Mindset for Better Products and Healthier PMs

When a PM tries to take on every responsibility, they often find themselves stretched thin, overlooking the very insights that would make the product shine. Worse, they risk burnout and tunnel vision, where personal biases and blind spots limit the product’s potential.

Imagine product management as steering a ship. If the PM is trying to captain, navigate, cook, and maintain the engine room, they’re likely to miss critical changes in weather or direction. However, when they let each crew member do their part, the PM can focus on steering the ship safely and accurately toward its destination, relying on the team’s expertise to handle the details that make for a successful journey.

**How can PMs move beyond the do-it-all mindset?** Recognize where others excel and empower them to contribute meaningfully. Hold regular check-ins to stay aligned without overstepping. This approach frees you to focus on ensuring the product maximizes value for users and drives business impact, trusting your team's expertise to bring these goals to life.

> A great product is never the work of one; it’s the result of the skillful blending of many hands, minds, and perspectives.

## Self-Assessment: Evolving Towards Collaborative Leadership

* Have you ever found yourself overwhelmed by trying to manage every aspect of a product? What effects did that have on your effectiveness and wellbeing?

* How could embracing collaboration more fully enhance not only your product's success but also your own development and wellbeing as a product manager?

* What beliefs or habits might be causing you to hold onto responsibilities that could be shared with or delegated to others? Are there areas where having others take lead could lead to better outcomes than trying to handle them yourself?

* Reflect on a time when collaborating with others led to a breakthrough you wouldn't have achieved alone. What did you learn from that experience? How can you have more of this kind of collaboration happen in your environment?
